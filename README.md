# SequentCalculus
This is a program to automate the process of solving sequent calculus problems.

*Instructions*

	(terminal)$ git clone git@github.com:ajrisylhasi/SequentCalculus.git

	cd SequentCalculus
	ruby main.rb
	

For help write 'Help'.
1. For implication use: >
2. For disjunction use: |
3. For conjunction use: &
4. For negation use:    !
5. For equivalence use: =
6. For consequence use: L
7. For comma use:       ,
8. For opening bracket: (
8. For closing bracket: )

This software will consider as atomic formula any set of characters that are not seperated by one of the functions.

An example of a correct Sequent is: (!(p>q)&!q)L(q=!p), !p
